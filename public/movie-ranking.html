<h1>The Best Movies According to Alex</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>1. The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King</h3>
<p>The third in line, but the best one out there.</p>

<h3>2. The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</h3>
<p>The second in line. This one is almost as good as the third one.</p>

<h3>3. The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring</h3>
<p>The first in line, but my least favorite of the three. But it's like choosing between one of your favorite children probably.</p>
